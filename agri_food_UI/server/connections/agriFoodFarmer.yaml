#
# [Required]. A connection profile contains information about a set of network
# components. It is typically used to configure gateway, allowing applications
# interact with a network channel without worrying about the underlying
# topology. A connection profile is normally created by an administrator who
# understands this topology.
#
 name: "agrifood.profile.sample"
#
# [Optional]. Analogous to HTTP, properties with an "x-" prefix are deemed
# "application-specific", and ignored by the gateway. For example, property
# "x-type" with value "hlfv1" was originally used to identify a connection
# profile for Fabric 1.x rather than 0.x.
#
# x-type: "hlfv1"
#
# [Required]. A short description of the connection profile
#
 description: "Sample connection profile for testing purpose using a farmer client"

# [Required]. Connection profile schema version. Used by the gateway to
# interpret these data.

#
# [Optional]. A logical description of each network channel; its peer and
# orderer names and their roles within the channel. The physical details of
# these components (e.g. peer IP addresses) will be specified later in the
